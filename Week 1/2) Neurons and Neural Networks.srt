00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.510
All the algorithms that are used in deep

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.150
learning are largely inspired by the way

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.880
neurons and neural networks function and

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
process data in the brain. This image is

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.969
one of the very first pictures of a

6
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.539
neuron. It was drawn by Santiago Ramon

7
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.170
y Cajal,

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.029
back in 1899 based on what he saw after

9
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.890
placing a pigeon's brain under the

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.560
microscope. He is now known as the father

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
of modern neuroscience, but based on his

12
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.200
drawing, the neurons, one of them labeled

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.590
A, have big bodies in the middle and long

14
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.200
arms that stretch out and branch off to

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.050
connect with other neurons. This other

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.940
image here is that of a neural network

17
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.640
and has a bunch or thousands of neurons

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.430
in what looks like a brain tissue. Tt

19
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.469
gives you a sense of how tightly they

20
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.930
are packed together and how many of them

21
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.940
are in a small brain tissue. Going back

22
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.160
to the drawing of neurons by Ramon y Cajal,

23
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.159
let's rotate it 90 degrees to the

24
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:05.610
left.

25
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.180
I bet this way it is starting to look a

26
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.220
little familiar since it slightly

27
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.350
resembles drawings of artificial neural

28
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.659
networks that you must have seen. Here is

29
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.020
a cartoon drawing of the neuron. The main

30
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.390
body of the neuron is called the soma,

31
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990
which contains the nucleus of the neuron.

32
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.240
The big network of arms sticking out of

33
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.369
the body is called the dendrites, and

34
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.520
then the long arm that sticks out of the

35
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.740
soma in the other direction is called

36
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.470
the axon. The whiskers at the end of the

37
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.810
axon are called the terminal buttons or

38
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020
synapses. So the dendrites receive

39
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.090
electrical impulses which carry

40
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
information, or data, from sensors or

41
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.799
terminal buttons of other adjoining

42
00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.560
neurons. The dendrites then carry the

43
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.320
impulses or data to the soma. In the

44
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.110
nucleus, electrical impulses, or the data,

45
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.960
are processed by combining them together,

46
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.869
and then they are passed on to the axon.

47
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.690
The axon then carries the processed

48
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.670
information to the terminal button or

49
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.650
synapse, and the output

50
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.989
of this neuron becomes the input to

51
00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.439
thousands of other neurons. Learning in

52
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.810
the brain occurs by repeatedly

53
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.970
activating certain neural connections

54
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.970
over others, and this reinforces those

55
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.730
connections. This makes them more likely

56
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.609
to produce a desired outcome given a

57
00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.790
specified input. Once the desired outcome

58
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.250
occurs, the neural connections causing

59
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.519
that outcome become strengthened. An

60
00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.620
artificial neuron behaves in the same

61
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.319
way as a biological neuron. So it

62
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.849
consists of a soma, dendrites, and an axon

63
00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.940
to pass on the output of this neuron to

64
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.060
other neurons. The end of the axon can

65
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.680
branch off to connect to many other

66
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.230
neurons, but for simplicity we are just

67
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.959
showing one branch here. The learning

68
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.540
process also very much resembles the way

69
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.359
learning occurs in the brain as you will

70
00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.709
see in the next couple of videos. Now

71
00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.720
that we understand the different parts

72
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.359
of an artificial neuron, let's learn how

73
00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.190
we formulate the way artificial neural

74
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.190
networks process information.
